"""Transient turn-scoped buff tables (GENERATED from cg.api.all_attack() + EN_Card_Data.csv).

DEFENSE_BUFF_ATTACKS: attackId -> damage reduction granted to the ATTACKER's own Pokémon
during the opponent's next turn (200 == "prevent all damage"). Detected from ATTACK logs
(carry attackId + serial) -> set on that unit's encoding unit_attr[23], active the turn after.

OFFENSE_BUFF_CARDS: Trainer/Item/Stadium cardId -> "this turn" extra attack damage. Detected
from our own PLAY logs (cardId) -> a CLS scalar. Pokémon ability/attack-based buffs are
EXCLUDED (abilities emit no log; playing a Pokémon to bench != using its buff).
