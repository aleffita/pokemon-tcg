"""Shape/layout constants for the encoders + token model -- the single source of truth.

Two groups: v1 (mlp Encoder) and v2 (TokenEncoder / TokenTransformer). They share several
names (MAX_HAND, MAX_OPTIONS, N_OPT_TYPES, ...). `MAX_DISCARD_MLP` (v1 window) is intentionally
distinct from `MAX_DISCARD` (v2 public discard budget) -- do not conflate. Imported by
rl/encoding.py (which re-exports them) and rl/policy.py.
