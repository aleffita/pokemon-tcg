"""Observation encoder: cabt ``obs`` dict -> fixed-shape numpy arrays.

Design (see rl/STATE_ACTION_SPACE.md for the full spec):

* Card identity is provided BOTH ways ("static features now, embedding hook"):
  every card surface emits a static feature array (from EN_Card_Data.csv) AND a
  raw integer id, so a CleanRL net can concat the static features with a learned
  ``nn.Embedding`` lookup.
* The action space is per-option: each candidate option gets its own feature row,
  the policy scores rows, and an action mask hides illegal/padded slots.

All arrays are float32 except ``*_id`` (int64). Everything is encoded from the
ACTING player's perspective (``current.yourIndex`` is "self").

v2 (post-audit) fixes:
* ACTIVE Pokémon is encoded as its own vector, BENCH pooled separately, so the
  policy can identify the in-combat Pokémon (previously active+bench were pooled
  together order-invariantly, hiding which one was active).
* DECK-SEARCH options carry no cardId; the chosen card lives in ``sel['deck']``.
  We resolve it (area==1 -> sel['deck'][index]) so search picks aren't blind.
* MAX_OPTIONS 64->96 (engine can emit up to ~69) and MAX_HAND 15->20.
* per-Pokemon count/energy features are clipped to [0,1] (no saturation).

v2.1 (information-gap fixes; obs semantics change -> retrain from scratch, old
checkpoints/BC datasets incompatible; MUST be mirrored in encode_native.pyx):
* self_deck stream keeps the FULL decklist and gains a per-copy DRAWABLE flag
  (``self_deck_flag``): 1 iff that copy is not visible in our public zones ==
  still in deck or face-down in our prizes (see ``decklist_drawable_flags``).
* opp_deck stream gains the analogous per-copy HIDDEN flag (``opp_deck_flag``):
  1 iff that revealed copy is not currently visible in a public zone (tracker
  belief; see ``GameTracker.copies_hidden_for``) or is an unrevealed UNK slot --
  i.e. plausibly still to come. Flags exist ONLY on the two deck streams.
* opt_attr gains an ALREADY-PICKED flag column (OPT_PICKED): multi-select picks
  stay visible-but-illegal, so later picks/submit see the set built so far.

v2.2 (precise opponent-hand eviction; obs semantics change -> retrain, MUST be
mirrored in encode_native.pyx + revalidated):
* GameTracker: the 1-turn TTL and the type-7 wipe-all-hand-beliefs are REPLACED
  by counting -- blind (identity-redacted) hand-exits are counted per player and
  a known-in-hand belief survives until an observed exit names its serial or the
  public hand size contradicts the belief count (``_enforce_hand_count``,
  uncertain-then-oldest evicted first). Engine-verified: hand-exits are never
  silent, and only 3 pool cards (182/1200/1248) can blind-exit a hand.
* opp_hand stream gains a per-token CERTAINTY flag (``opp_hand_flag``): 1 iff no
  blind hand-exit was observed since that belief was stamped (UNK fill/pad = 0).

    """Per-game memory of which cards (and HOW MANY distinct copies) each player has revealed.

    For each ``playerIndex`` we store, per cardId, the SET OF SERIALS seen. A serial is a
    unique per-physical-card id, so ``len(serials)`` is the true number of distinct copies
    that player has shown -- a single card cycling play->discard->hand->play keeps ONE serial
    (no over-count), while two real copies contribute two. Serials are populated from two
    sources, unioned (so the set dedups automatically):
      (1) reveal LOGS (PLAY/ATTACH/EVOLVE/DEVOLVE/MOVE_CARD/MOVE_ATTACHED/ATTACK -- all carry
          cardId+serial) -> catches copies that have since returned to a hidden zone;
      (2) CURRENTLY-VISIBLE cards (discard, board Pokemon + their preevo/tools/energy, stadium)
          -> catches copies whose move-log we never observed.

    IMPORTANT: ``obs['logs']`` is an INCREMENTAL delta (verified -- log length is non-monotonic),
    NOT cumulative, so ``update(obs)`` must run on every decision obs this side sees; the serial
    SETS persist across the game. Attribution is by ``playerIndex`` (perspective-independent), so
    one tracker serves both sides -- each reads ``copies_for(its_opponent_index)``. ``reset()`` per game.
